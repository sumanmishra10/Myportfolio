                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I am Suman Mishra, a dedicated Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. My technical skills span across various technologies, including Python, .NET, and Flutter, allowing me to build robust backend systems as well as intuitive front-end interfaces.
                    Over the years, I have honed my skills through various projects, each challenging me to innovate and deliver solutions that meet user needs. My experience includes developing RESTful APIs, integrating third-party services, and implementing user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
                    I am proficient in working with databases such as SQL Server and MySQL, ensuring data integrity and optimizing query performance. In addition, my knowledge of AWS allows me to deploy and manage applications in the cloud, providing scalable and reliable services.
                    Beyond my technical abilities, I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends. 
                    I am a strong advocate of best practices in software development, including code reviews, unit testing, and agile methodologies.
                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and participating in tech communities. I am also an avid reader and love to travel, experiencing different cultures and gaining new perspectives.
                    Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I have worked on and get in touch if you have any questions or collaboration ideas. Thank you for visiting!</p>
